- make libPath actually work
- clean up unused code (like client.sync bit)
- describe API
- deal with opening the syncFrame on the same domain in various tabs ("I'm Brian of Nazarath" message across tabs? otherwise send custom event or detect setting of special localStorage key)
- deal with upload failures (pull can be parallel, push should be serial)
- deal with upload timeouts
- send index on failure or on completion (actually, if pushing a specific key fail, pushing index could also fail)
- prevent browsing away while syncing
- tutorial with -new1, -new2. existing tutorial becomes 'advanced'
